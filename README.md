# ConsuladoBot

This Python script automatically checks the next available date for inscription at a Spanish consulate. It navigates the consulate's website to find and extract the appointment date. If a new date is available, the script sends a notification via Telegram to inform the user of the updated date. This script is meant to ease the task of constantly checking the consulate's website for new appointment dates, automating the process and providing timely updates to the user.
